  Follow instructions here to integrate your website via Segment
</Card>

Typically this integration is owned by engineering or marketing.

## Step 2: Turn on website intent data

Turn on website intent data so that you start revealing the companies behind anonymous website traffic. In Unify you can leverage one of these approaches:

1. Unify Intent (Powered by 6sense): get access to intent data at [Settings > Unify intent](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/unify-intent) through just a couple button clicks
2. Clearbit Reveal: connect your existing account to leverage Clearbit Reveal data in Unify
3. 6sense: connect your existing account to leverage 6sense data in Unify

[See here](/intent) for our support doc on how to turn on intent data.

## Step 3: Integrate your CRM

Please follow the complete guide [here](/integrations/salesforce) to integrate your Salesforce instance. A summary of the process:

1. Pick integration user strategy
2. Create `Unify Tag` field on Lead, Contact and Account objects
3. Link Salesforce via Unify Settings Page
4. Create field mapping between Salesforce and Unify objects
5. Enable writing records to Salesforce, and choose Lead or Contact/Account data model

Typically this integration is owned by a sales leader or sales / revenue operations.

<Note>
  ⚡ Our Hubspot integration will be coming soon - if you'd like to be notified
  when this is released let us know at hello@unifygtm.com.
</Note>

## Step 4: Build your first audience

Audiences in Unify are lists of companies and/or people, similar to a Salesforce report. Use them to build lists based on Salesforce data, website intent data, and more. Please see our [guide to using audiences here](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-an-audience-230cfa6fbc8945dfa28c18adb03276f6?pvs=21).
