## Step 1: Integrate your website

You have 3 options for integrating your website to Unify:

1. Javascript Snippet: install the Unify JavaScript tag directly on your website. Navigate to [Settings > Integrations > Website Tag](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/website-tag) to get your tag
2. Google Tag Manager: install the Unify JavaScript tag in Google Tag Manager. Navigate to [Settings > Integrations > Website Tag](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/website-tag) to get your tag, and make sure to enable [Support document.write](https://www.notion.so/Integrate-Unify-to-your-website-9d085875792e4ef5ba69e6ef81e7e553?pvs=21).
3. Segment: follow [instructions here](/integrations/segment) to integrate your website via Segment

Typically this integration is owned by engineering or marketing.

## Step 2: Turn on website intent data

Turn on website intent data so that you start revealing the companies behind anonymous website traffic. In Unify you can leverage one of these approaches:

1. Unify Intent (Powered by 6sense): get access to intent data at [Settings > Unify intent](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/unify-intent) through just a couple button clicks
2. Clearbit Reveal: connect your existing account to leverage Clearbit Reveal data in Unify
3. 6sense: connect your existing account to leverage 6sense data in Unify

[See here](/intent) for our support doc on how to turn on intent data.

## Step 4: Build your first audience

Audiences in Unify are lists of companies and/or people, similar to a Salesforce report. Use them to build lists based on Salesforce data, website intent data, and more. Please see our [guide to using audiences here](https://www.notion.so/How-to-create-an-audience-230cfa6fbc8945dfa28c18adb03276f6?pvs=21).
