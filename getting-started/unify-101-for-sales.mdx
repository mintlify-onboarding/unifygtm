Unify helps you identify the right companies to reach out to based on who is demonstrating intent on your website. Know as soon as a company hits your website and takes high intent actions like visiting your pricing page or your technical support docs. 

Typically `<5%` of your website visitors leave their contact info, while as much as 30-50% of visitors can be revealed via intent data. These revealed companies are fantastic to prospect given they might already being in a buying pattern. 

Example audiences you might track with Unify:

1. Rep assigned accounts that have recent website activity
2. Companies visiting high intent pages (e.g., pricing or book a demo)
3. Companies that come to the website after receiving a sales touch (email or call)
4. Companies that return to the website 30+ days after a sales touch (opportunity to re-engage)
5. Companies with a closed lost opportunity that have returned to the website (opportunity to re-engage)
