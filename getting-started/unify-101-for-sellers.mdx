## Monitor high intent audiencese

Typically sales leaders or revenue or sales operations will create audiences for sellers. You can access audiences [here](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/audiences).

We recommend that you create audiences to access valuable pockets of intent data that you want to come back to. This makes it fast and easy to quickly focus on the companies that are great prospecting opportunities. Example audiences:

1. Your owned accounts that have recent website activity
2. Companies visiting high intent pages (e.g., pricing or book a demo), but haven’t booked a demo or signed up
3. Companies that come to the website immediately after receiving a sales activity (email or call)
4. Companies that return to the website 30+ days after sales activity (there’s potential to re-engage)
5. Companies with a closed lost opportunity that have returned to the website (there’s potential to re-engage)

Example audience of companies that visited unifygtm.com in the past 7 days.
