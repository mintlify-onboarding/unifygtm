## Add the javascript tag to your website

Navigate to [Settings > Integrations > Website Tag](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/integrations/website-tag) in the Unify product and copy the javascript tag below the `<body>` tag of your website.

- This tag can be installed both directly on your website as well as in Google Tag Manager
- Typically the website is owned by a marketing or engineering team - you may need to work with them to get the tag installed

NOTE: If using Google Tag Manager to install the Unify Tag, make sure to enable `Support document.write` here:
