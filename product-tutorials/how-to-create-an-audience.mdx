title: "How to Create an Audience"
description: "Audiences in Unify are lists of companies and/or people, similar to a Salesforce report. Use them to build lists based on Salesforce data, website intent data, and more."
---

Typically sales leaders or revenue or sales operations will create audiences for sellers and to build playbooks on. You can access audiences [here](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/audiences) in your Unify app.

## Example audiences

These are some example audiences that you might build:

1. Your owned accounts that have recent website activity
2. Companies visiting high intent pages (e.g., pricing or book a demo), but haven’t booked a demo or signed up
3. Companies that come to the website immediately after receiving a sales activity (email or call)
4. Companies that return to the website 30+ days after sales activity (there’s potential to re-engage)
5. Companies with a closed lost opportunity that have returned to the website (there’s potential to re-engage)

Here’s an example audience of companies that visited our website in the past 7 days:

Here’s what an audience looks like when you’re building it:

## Creating an audience

Navigate to the [Audiences tab](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/audiences) in Unify. You have 2 options to create an audience:

1. Create with audience builder - use this approach when the data that you want to build on is in Salesforce, the website, or another source that Unify integrates with
2. Upload a CSV - use this approach when you’re using a static list (e.g., you’re going to a conference and have a list of target accounts)

## Create an audience with audience builder

Click `+ New audience` in the top right of the screen

Select `Create new` or `Duplicate and edit from an existing audience`

Name your audience and start filtering for companies or people. Under the hood, audiences functions a lot like a SQL query, allowing you to join together different datasets.

- When you filter on companies, people (contacts or leads) associated with those companies will automatically be included or excluded from the audience

Here’s an example audience that we’ve built, filtering to companies that visited our website in the past 7 days and are not accounts in Salesforce. In the preview, you’ll see that only 1 company is included in this audience.

Once you have the desired filters set and you’ve named your audience, click `Create audience` and you’re done!

## Condition Groups

Condition groups are designed to nest AND and OR statements however you see fit. Use them to build more complex audiences.

## Create an audience from a CSV

You may want to create an audience from a CSV for something like attending a conference. Navigate to the [Audiences tab](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/audiences) in Unify and click `Upload CSV` to begin.

![csv 1.png](/images/10.png)

Name your audience and upload your CSV (we require company names and websites)

![csv 2.png](/images/11.png)

You’ll see this message when your CSV has been successfully uploaded

![csv 3.png](/images/12.png)

Map the columns of the CSV to Unify fields and click `Finish` when you’re ready

Success, your new audience has been created.
