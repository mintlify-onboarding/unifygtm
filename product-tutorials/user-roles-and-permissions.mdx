title: "User Roles and Permissions"
description: "Unify has 2 user roles - `Admins` and `Users`. To invite users to the product navigate to [Settings > Users > Invite](https://app.unifygtm.com/dashboard/settings/organization/users). While there are no restrictions on the number of each type of user that you can have, we recommend keeping the number of admins to a minimum."

## Admins

Admins are super users of Unify. We recommend that sales leaders, revenue and sales operations be Admins in Unify. Admins have full access to Unify:

1. Access to setup and modify integrations
2. View companies and people
3. View and create audiences
4. View and create playbooks
5. View and create personas
6. Add and delete users  

## Users

We typically recommend that AEs/SDRs be assigned as Users on Unify. Users have the following permissions:

1. View companies and people
2. View and create audiences
3. View playbooks
4. View personas
5. View users  

Reps cannot do actions like create playbooks, personas or invite other users to Unify. They also do not have access to integrations.
