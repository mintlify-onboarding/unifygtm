## Example personas

Here are some of the personas that we care about at Unify:

1. Sales leaders (CRO, VP of Sales)
2. Individual sellers (Account Executives, SDR/BDRs)
3. Marketers (Growth marketing)

## Creating a persona

Navigate to the personas tab and click `New persona` to get started

How to create personas:

1. Use `Includes` to tell us any job titles that you want to include in this persona
2. When searching for prospects we do a `contains` search
    1. If you plug in “vp of sales” as a job title, we will also return “svp of sales” because “vp of sales” is fully contained in it
3. `Excludes` is used to prevent returning of prospects that you didn’t expect. A great example is if you find you’re getting interns from Unify, you may want to exclude “intern” 

<Tip>
    If you have many job titles in a Google Sheet or Excel Sheet, you can copy and paste them directly into Unify. [See here for a tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/554849abffc748aa978df2a6338d7dcd).

Click `Create persona` when you’re done.
